# 3D-Residual-Autoencoder-for-HSI-classification

This is a module to create an autoencoder with 3D CNNs and rsidual connection to reduce the high dimensional hyperspectral image (HSI) data to a lower dimension for classification purpose. The code is written in Python using Tensorflow 2.0/Keras. Random forest classifier is used to evaluate the accuracy after feature extraction.
